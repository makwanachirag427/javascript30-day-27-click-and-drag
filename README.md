# JavaScript30 Challenge - Day 27: Click and Drag

Welcome to Day 27 of the JavaScript30 Challenge, where we'll be exploring "Click and Drag." In this project, we'll be creating a click-and-drag interface for scrolling through a horizontal list of items.

## Project Overview

In this project, we'll build a simple web interface that allows users to click and drag to scroll through a list of items horizontally. We'll utilize HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to create this interactive experience.

## Project Structure

The project will consist of the following files:

1. `index.html`: The HTML file for the project, defining the structure of the page.
2. `styles.css`: The CSS file to style the elements and create the layout.
3. `script.js`: The JavaScript file where we'll write the logic for the click-and-drag functionality.


## Project Details

In this project, we will implement the following functionality:
- Create a horizontal scrolling list of items.
- Implement click-and-drag functionality to scroll through the list by dragging the mouse.
